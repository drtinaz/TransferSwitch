This service is intended to monitor a digital input that is connected to a remote generator.
Select the digital input type 'bilge pump' that has the state of 'on' or 'off'
the digital input reflects the current state of the remote generator, either 'on' for running
or 'off' for not running. Ie: input source is generator or grid (or shore)
when on generator this script will attempt to set the current ac input limit to the generator limit
when on grid or shore this script wuill attempt to set the ac input current limit to the grid/shore setting
this script stores the generator and grid settings in the system settings for later retrieval.
